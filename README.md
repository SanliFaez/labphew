*labphew* is a minimalist code and folder structure for developing a computer-controlled experiment in Python. The main purpose of Labphew is to provide a basis for those with little coding experience to build their own user-interface(s) for a piece of hardware or to control a measurement. 

### Python for the Lab
-------------
This project is heavily inspired by the instruction exercise written by [Dr. Aquiles Carattino](https://www.uetke.com), the mastermind behind [Python for the Lab](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/). If you want to learn more (serious!) coding for lab automation with Python, check the excellent [PTFL website](https://www.pythonforthelab.com/) or book him for a course.

Python for the Lab (PFTL) is a code architecture and a programming course for computer-controlled instrumentation. PTFL codes are designed following the MVC design pattern, splitting the code into Controllers for defining drivers, Models for specifying the logic of the experiment, and View for parking the GUI.
PFTL was developed by [Uetke](https://www.uetke.com) to explain to researchers, through simple examples, what can be achieved quickly with little programming experience. The ultimate goal of this project is to serve as a reference place for people interested in instrumentation written in Python.

## The labphew package
---------------------
Currently, the labphew package contains more wishes than executable pieces. However you can use its framework as a (hopefully convenient) starting point to write your own code. Please note that this package is published under [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).
